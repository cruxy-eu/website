# Rust

In the last few years,
I have switched annotations from Java to lifetimes in Rust.
This has been a great experience,
and this allowed me to write more reliable code.

## Experience

I have been using Rust for about 3 years now,
and I have used it in various projects:

- [Kannika](https://docs.kannika.io)
- [SAME](https://github.com/cymo-eu/same)
