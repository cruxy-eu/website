# Rust

In the last few years,
I have switched annotations from [Java](/skills/java) to lifetimes in Rust.
This has been a great experience,
and this allowed me to write more reliable code with less boilerplate.

## Experience

So far, I have used Rust for building:

- Web services using [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) or [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/).
- Asynchronous applications with [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) or [monoio](https://github.com/bytedance/monoio) runtimes.
- CLI tools using [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap).
- Kubernetes operators using the [kube-rs](https://kube.rs/) library.
- Cross-platform applications with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/).

## Projects

Here are some of the Rust projects I have worked on:

- [Kannika Armory](https://docs.kannika.io/): A Kubernetes-native platform for backing up and restoring Kafka clusters.
- [SAME](https//github.com/cymo-eu/same): A tool for mapping schemas between different Kafka clusters.
- [kbridge](https://github.com/cymo-eu/kannika-bridge): A tool for mapping offsets between different Kafka clusters.
