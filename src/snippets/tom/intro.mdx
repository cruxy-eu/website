I'm a freelance developer specializing in backend systems and high-performance applications.
The last years have seen me dive deep into Rust.

# My Tech Toolbox

1. High-Performance Systems with Rust


2. Enterprise Systems with Java
When I started my career in 2009,
Java was the dominant language for building robust backend systems.
Deploys were done with WAR files to Tomcat servers or similar,
and there was no such thing as "cloud-native".
Over the years, I've worked extensively with Java and its ecosystem,
including Spring Boot, Hibernate, and various databases.
I have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming,
design patterns, and best practices in software development.

3. Cloud & DevOps
I build and deploy applications using a cloud-native approach.

- Containerization with Docker
- Writing Kubernetes operators
