I am the technical lead and product owner for [Kannika](https://kannika.io),
a Kubernetes-native platform for backing up and restoring Kafka clusters.
Here I made the switch from Java to Rust full-time,
and I am enjoying every bit of it.
Being part of a small team means I get to wear many hats,
from coding to customer support and everything in between.
