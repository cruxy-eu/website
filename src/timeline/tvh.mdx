At TVH / mateco I was part of a digital transformation journey that spanned multiple years,
which got me into [EDA](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html) and Kafka early on.
I was fortunate to lead a team of talented developers.
We built an event-driven platform
on top of Kafka that supported various digital initiatives,
including e-commerce platforms and rental management systems.
I am proud of the work we did there.
