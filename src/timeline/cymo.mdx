Cymo focuses on event-driven architectures (EDA), and was founded by my former colleagues at TVH.
At Cymo, I am the technical lead and product owner for [Kannika](https://docs.kannika.io),
a Kubernetes-native platform for backing up Kafka clusters.
Here I made the switch from Java to Rust full-time,
and I am enjoying every bit of it.
