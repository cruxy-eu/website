import { components } from '../components/mdx/components.js';

Here I found myself in the banking world for the first time, among the Dutch!
I got to tackle core features for 7 million users,
including the critical services that handle transactions (e.g. that thing that makes money go out of your account).
Standards were extremely high
and I learned a lot about security, reliability, and performance.
